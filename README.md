## About the Project ##
Developed for UK Fuels as a replacement to a spreadsheet driven system that took daily stats input and produced a series of reports, however over time their previous system had become broken and unusable.

This new system is built around the Django framework from Python to fall in line with internal company standards, and to make it easier for their in house team to support.

The system allows for tracking for multiple different teams and agents, and to generate aggregate stats based on performance, as well as use those performance figures to create an in house competition to help drive sales performance.
